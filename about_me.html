      <h2>Detailed About</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm James Perenchio, a versatile IT professional based in Melbourne, Australia.<br><br> 
        With a Bachelor of Information Technology from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and certifications 
        in CompTIA Network+ and Responsive Web Design, I bring a blend of technical expertise and creativity to my work. 
        I am gearing up for my CCNA certification where I will hopefully learn more about networking and security.<br><br>
        Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in technical troubleshooting, networking, and programming with languages like Java and Python. 
        My proficiency with AWS, SQL, and Bash scripting has enabled me to develop effective solutions and optimize various IT processes. 
        I am always on the lookout for new technologies and tools to enhance my skill set and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving tech industry.<br><br>

        <b>Professional Experience:</b>
        
       <h3 id ="IT-support-title">IT Support Officer at Monash University</h3> 
       I significantly improved student satisfaction by diagnosing and solving technical issues efficiently. I was in charge of working directly with the students
       by responding to any technical issues they had. I had to liase with the IT team to ensure that the issues were resolved in a timely manner. <br><br>
        
       <h3 id = "Customer-Service-title">Customer Service Representative at QT Melbourne Rooftop</h3>
       I was in charge of crafting a memorable experience for guests by providing exceptional customer service. I had to work in a team to ensure that the guests were satisfied with the 
       service they received. <br><br>
       I actively engaged in cocktail making courses both online and in person to improve my skills in mixology. With my interest in cooking, I am eager to learn more 
       about drinks and how they pair up well with different types of foods. With these two things combined, I am confident in being able to upsell most products and
       give the guest the best experience they could have. There were definitely a lot of crazy nights and events that I went through, but I took it as another 
       learning opportunity. I also made a lot of long lasting friends working here. <br><br>

       <h3 id = "HooHaa-title"> Bartender at HooHaa@MissKuku</h3> Although this was my first job in the hospitality industry, I was able to learn a lot about customer service and how to interact with customers.
       I started off as a back of house and over time, I gained the confidence to ask one of my coworkers about mixology.
       They slowly showed me the ropes and after asking for approval from the manager, I made my way into learning about the basics of making drinks.
       Over time, I worked my way up to becoming a bartender, especially when things were slow and I had more free time at work. This has definitely helped me in my career and confidence as I had to interact
       with customers on the daily. This job was where I learned a lot about the industry and I am grateful for the opportunity to work here. <br><br>
